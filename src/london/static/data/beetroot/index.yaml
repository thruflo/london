  <p>
    Beatroot is a little cafe serving a daily buffet of vegetarian goodness, 
    along with smoothies and cakes.

  <p>
    Perched on the side of Berwick street, you get to watch the fruit and veg
    market as the stallholders badger each other over football results and
    the pimps shift past on their way to the alley of shame.

    This is Soho at its best and its most filling.  Don't let the carnivores 
    say nay.

  <p>
    The finest of London coffee dispensers, the Monmouth Coffee Company is an 
    oasis of darkly roasted intensity in a desert of over steamed slosh.
  </p>
  <p>
    The staff are super friendly and you can deliberate with them over which
    coffee you want your chest hair raising espresso to be made with today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Look downstairs as you're queuing and you'll see their original roasting 
    kitchen. There are small, shared wooden tables at the back, benches to perch
    on out front or you can take away to nearby Seven Dials.

  <p>
    Ever so slightly too trendy for its own good, Lantana thankfully also serves
    some of the best coffee in town.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tucked away on picturesque Charlotte Place, near the corner of Charlotte
    Street and Googe Street, the coffee and drinks are optionally accompanied by
    australian-influenced comfort food.
